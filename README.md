# BT Components
Experimenting with Bluetooth components introduced me to the world of wireless control and connectivity. Using Arduino and Bluetooth modules, I learned how to remotely operate everything from LEDs to servo and DC motors with commands sent from a phone. This opened up countless possibilities for creating smart, interactive devices that respond to inputs with ease.
